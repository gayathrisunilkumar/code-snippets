<p> An average third year CSE student and a passionate traveller,My very first attempt of making something creative in life. I have been doing really nothing for a long long time i guess.

I didnt set out with any particular purpose in mind.But it seems to have evolved as a way of sharing favourite visuals.I am making it up as i go along Or storing treasured memories through snapshots.I am a bit reticent with words,although I love using other peoples words(quotes)to go with particular scenes!!

This is all about my journey,which is yet to come,my experiences,the lessons i learned,and also something i would like to say to all</p></font>
